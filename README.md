Steps

1. cd pf_sandbox root file:
2. in terminal run:
   npm install && npm run dev
3. open in browser: localhost:3000

Note:

- I have set up your test env in src/sandbox
  you can ignore the Sandbox.jsx
- make functions in functions.js and if you want to run them
  add them into the the "Main" function.
- an example with cats is there.

How it works:

- you are given a duplicate of the data that you can edit with functions
- the rendered data is replaced on run Main()
